<h1>About</h1>
<p>&emsp; <b> Interests:</b> First-principles atomistic modeling, Defect thermodynamics, Phase stability, Renewable energy, Interface chemistry, 
Materials informatics.</p>

<p>
  &emsp; Dr. Prince Gollapalli, being a metallurgical and materials engineer by training, focuses on understanding 
  the structure-property correlation in metals, semiconductors, materials with defects using
  first-principles atomistic modeling approach based on density functional theory.
  Such theory can help calculate the properties of materials at a fundamental level.
  This understading can be used to design materials: alloys for high strength applications to advaced semiconudctors
  for renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells.
</p>

<p> 
	 &emsp; His current research as a postdoc at Techion - Israel Institute of Technology, focuses on developing electrolyte 
	 materials for proton ceramic fuel cells with experimental collaboration. As a visiting scholar to Purdue University during his Ph.D., 
	 he worked on using physics-driven first-principles calculations to accelerate the defect prediction in semiconductors
	 using graph neural networks, a data-driven approach. 
	For his Ph.D. at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, he worked on predicitng the nature of interface
	between metals and ceramics, which is assumed to be atomically sharp, hence	two-dimensional.
	He proposed a third dimension at the metal/ceramic (Ti/TiN) interface by forming
	thermodynamically stable stoichiometric phases, within a few nm, causing atomic-level chemical gradation resulting in
 continually varying mechanical properties. 
	He also studied a range of technologically and scientifically important metal/ceramic systems, 
	where their nano-heterostructures find applications in our daily life, such as turbine blades, biological implants, 
	various components of cell phones.

<! 
For his M.E at Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, he 

 and B.Tech from National Institute of Technology Warangal,
he has handson experince with metallographic sample preparation, using characterization facilities such as optical microscope, SEM,
TEM, mechanical testing
