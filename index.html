<h1>About</h1>
<p>&emsp; <b> Interests:</b> First-principles atomistic modeling, Defect thermodynamics, Phase stability, Renewable energy, Interface chemistry, 
Materials informatics.</p>

<p>
  &emsp; Dr. Prince Gollapalli is a metallurgical and materials engineer by training.
	He received B.Tech, M.E,  and Ph.D degrees in metallurgical and/or materials engineering from
	NIT Warangal, IISc Bangalore, and IIT Madras, respectively.
	
	His research involves the 
	integration of first-principles atomistic modeling into materials science to obtain fundamental insights into the
	structure-property correlation. Such insights help address problems in rational materials desgin. As a postdoctoral 
	fellow at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, he is designing electrolyte materials for fuel cells to enhance
	ionic conductivity. As a visiting scholar to Purdue University during his Ph.D., 
	 he worked on integrating machine learning into first-principles calculations to accelerate the defect prediction in semiconductors.

</p>

<p> 
	 &emsp; For his Ph.D., he provided insights into the fundamental nature of interface between metals and ceramics.
	The interface between a metal and a ceramic is assumed to be atomically sharp, thus two-dimensional,
	because exchange of atoms across the interface is not favorable. First-principles modeling helped predict 
	a third dimension at the Ti/TiN (metal/ceramic) interface which forms by stoichiometric phases of Ti-N,
	within a few nm, with continually varying mechanical properties across the interface. 
	He also studied a range of technologically and scientifically important metal/ceramic systems, 
	where their nano-heterostructures find applications in turbine blades, biological implants, 
	various components of cell phones.  
<! 
For his M.E at Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, he 

 and B.Tech from National Institute of Technology Warangal,
he has handson experince with metallographic sample preparation, using characterization facilities such as optical microscope, SEM,
TEM, mechanical testing
