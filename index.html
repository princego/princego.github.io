<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  &emsp; Dr. Prince Gollapalli is a postdoctoral fellow in Materials Science and Engineering at Technion - Israel Institute of
	Technology. He did his Ph.D. in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
	He holds M.E degree in Materials Engineering from Indian Institute of Science Bangalore and B.Tech in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from National Institute of Technology Warangal. During his Ph.D., he had a 4 month stint in the School of Materials Engineering at Purdue University as a visiting scholar.<br> <br>

	 &emsp; His research focuses on using his expertise in first-principles materials design to develop materials for renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells. As a visiting scholar to Purdue University, he worked on using physics-driven first-principles calculations to accelerate the defect prediction in semiconductors using graph neural networks, a data-driven approach. 
	For his Ph.D., he worked on interface between metals and ceramics, which is assumed to be two-dimensional. He proposed a third dimension to the metal/ceramic (Ti/TiN) system, via atomic-level chemical gradation by forming thermodynamically stable stoichiometric phases across the Ti/TiN interface, within a few nm. 
	He also studied a range of metal/ceramic systems, where their nano-heterostructures find applications in our daily life, such as turbine blades, biological implants, various components of cell phones, etc. 
	First-principles intuition to the atomic-level gradation provides a new dimension in controlling the properties of nano-heterostructures paving a new avenue to design new heterostructures with tailored properties through smooth variation of structural parameters and properties across the interface, which can help achieve composites and nano-heterostructures with unprecedented mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties.
