<h1>About</h1>

<p>

Prince Gollapalli holds an undergraduate degree in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from National Institute of Technology Warangal, India and a masterâ€™s in materials engineering at Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, India. He continued his studies at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India under the supervision of <a href="https://mme.iitm.ac.in/satyesh/" target="blank">Dr. Satyesh Kumar Yadav</a> from Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. His Ph.D. work focuses on gaining atomic-level insights into anion migration from ceramic to metal by tapping into the predictive power of first-principles density functional theory based on the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. Ceramics are known to be stronger and inert, thus should not allow any kind of atomic intermixing. Counter-intuitively, we show that N migration from TiN to Ti is thermodynamically more stable than TiN/Ti without N migration. We also show that lattice spacing and mechanical properties vary gradually across the interface. Such interface is encountered in applications including wear-resistant coatings, diffusion barrier layers in electronic devices, energy materials, etc.

I would also like to explore the properties of new materials by bridging physics-driven first-principles and data-driven machine learning approaches.
